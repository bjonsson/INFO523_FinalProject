# INFO523_FinalProject

This repository is for a graduate level class at the University of Arizona called "Data Mining and Discovery" (Fall, 2022). 

We are to produce a video exploring a method we did not cover in class for our final project.

The presentation must include code placed on GitHub that we have altered in some fashion.
